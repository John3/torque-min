# torque-min

This is a minimal version of TGE with everything except the core stripped away. Do note that the actual engine source has not been modified, which means that it is not as minimal as it could be.

## Usage

Run `torque.exe`. It will execute `main.cs` quietly, and then step down to a simple command-line TorqueScript interpreter.
